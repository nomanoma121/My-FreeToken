"""Run a prefill chunk's sequence mixers (GDN / attention) in pieces and its MoE whole.

Why: on an offloaded MoE every prefill chunk streams every layer's expert bank to the GPU,
so the number of chunks a prompt is cut into is the number of full bank transfers it pays
(on an RTX 2060, 16.9 GiB per chunk at ~11 GB/s: 1.5 s of a 4.5 s chunk). The chunk width is
capped by the per-token transient, and that cap is set by the mixers, not the experts --
measured on Ornith with 1024 tokens per call:

    GDN        116.5 KiB/token
    attention   79.8 KiB/token
    MoE         16.7 KiB/token

The layer's peak is its largest component, so the GDN decides how wide a chunk may be.

Mixers are sequential in the token dimension and already support resuming from a cached
prefix -- that is what chunked prefill across forwards is -- so a forward can run them over
consecutive pieces of the same chunk, each piece continuing the one before it, and bound
their transient by the piece. The MoE is per-token and cannot tell the difference, so it runs
once over the whole chunk and its bank crosses the bus once per layer. The engine's transient
probe runs a real forward, so it measures the smaller peak on its own and the chunk-width
solver picks a wider chunk: fewer chunks, fewer bank transfers, same arithmetic per token.

Each piece is a shallow copy of the chunk's batch with its own request proxy (cached_len
advanced by the pieces before it) and its own attention and GDN metadata, built by the same
builders the scheduler uses -- so the continuation semantics are the ones already exercised by
chunked prefill, not new ones.

The hybrid-radix snapshot is the one delicate part. The scheduler builds the chunk's GDN
metadata before the forward, and that build both picks the snapshot slot and advances the
request's ping-pong index. A piece must therefore not pick it again: only the last piece
tracks, using the index as it was before the scheduler's build, and the split points are kept
on the 64-token lattice the snapshot boundaries live on, so the last piece's deepest boundary
is exactly the chunk's.
